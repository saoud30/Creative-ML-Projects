# 🍂 Autumn Air Quality → Health Risk Analysis

## Why this project?
Air quality worsens during autumn due to weather inversion, crop burning, and reduced wind flow.
Most dashboards show AQI numbers — but people don’t know what that means for their health.

This project translates air pollution data into **human health risk insights**.

---

## What it does
- Analyzes real air-quality data (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂)
- Builds a custom **Health Risk Index**
- Compares a polluted city vs a clean city:
  - Delhi 🇮🇳
  - Helsinki 🇫🇮
- Generates plain-English health advisories

---

## Key Features
- Seasonal (autumn-focused) analysis
- City-to-city comparison
- Health-aware feature engineering
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Ethical use of public data (no private health records)

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Open-Meteo Air Quality API
- Streamlit

---

## Who is this for?
